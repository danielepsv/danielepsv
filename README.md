## Hi there! 👋
### My name is Daniele.
####  I am passionate about learning and futher developing my skills.

A software developer from Portugal.<br>
I've always been drawn to the overlap between design and development.<br>
I enjoy losing the time required to correct small details and optimize code, I love details.<br>
Over the years, I have worked on a variety of projects using different technologies,
both backend and frontend development.<br>
Whenever time allows I'm constantly learning new web technologies and other programming 
languages! I'm curious by nature. 👀<br>
When I'm not working or coding, you can find me spending time reading a book, enjoying a
movie, or playing games. 🌛<br><br>


Some fun facts: <br><br>
  🎮 I have more video games than I find the time to play<br>
  📚 I've started a sci-fi book collection <br>
   ✏️ I love to draw<br>

<br>
I'm passionate about:<br><br>
  👾 Pixel art<br>
  🎮 Video games<br><br>

<br>
Thank you for taking the time to read. 😊<br>
