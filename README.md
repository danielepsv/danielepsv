## Hello stranger! 👋😊
### My name is Daniele.
####  I ❤️‍🔥 building beautiful interfaces &amp; experiences.<br/>I 💖 details and making 🐛 turn into 🦋 using &lt; &sol;&gt; and ✨!<br/>

I'm a software developer from Portugal.<br/>
I am passionate about learning web technologies and other programming related topics. I do what I 💖 and I 💖 what I do.<br/>
I value clarity, empathy, and integrity above all else. These ideals guide my approach to problem solving and life in general.<br/>

Over the years, I have worked on a variety of projects using different technologies, both backend and frontend development.<br/>
I'm curious by nature. 👀<br/>
I ❤️‍🔥 learning from past experiences and building better things.<br/>
I enjoy losing the time required to correct small details and optimize code.<br/>
When I'm not working or coding, you can find me spending time reading a book, enjoying a movie, or playing games. 🌛<br/>

Need geeky coding help, or just want to say hi? Go ahead. 📢<br/>
Find me on social media or [say hello](danielecarvalho86@gmail.com).<br/>
Thank you for taking the time to read. 🖖😎<br/><br/>
