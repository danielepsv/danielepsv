## Hello stranger! ðŸ‘‹
### My name is Daniele. 
#### I'm a software engineer and I'm interested in web technology, games and cybersecurity. ðŸ˜Š<br/><br/>

I am able to quickly learn new tools and technologies when needed and always up for a challenge.<br/>
I love the challenge of solving problems, I'm curious by nature.ðŸŒ›<br/>
I value clarity, empathy, and integrity above all else. These ideals guide my approach to problem solving and life in general.<br/><br/>

What I love the most about working in software development is being able to solve problems and learning from past experiences and building better things.<br/>
Whenever time allows I spend my energy investigating new technologies and researching cybersecurity, I also love to read and play games (when I have time to do so).<br/><br/>

Thank you for stopping by. ðŸ––ðŸ˜Ž<br/>
Whether you have a question or just want to say hi. [Go ahead](danielecarvalho86@gmail.com).<br/>
Donâ€™t be a stranger! ðŸ˜Š<br/><br/>
